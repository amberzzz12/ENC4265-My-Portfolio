In this analysis I used the Wayback Machine to see how websites were formatted back in the day. After examining the Food Network, Yahoo!, and Stack Overflow, I was surprised to notice how the fonts, colors, and overall display of the page is so different today. The overall design and flow of the websites makes it hard for users to search or even browse around. I also noticed how there is too much information on one page and how the fonts/background colors of the page affect the aesthetic of the page. I noticed how these sites also did not have proper formatting when it comes to the display and look of the websites. Nowadays the norms of websites incorporate better designs with an easy to use format and pictures that help add purpose to the website. Today, websites also adapt to different screen sizes so it remains easy to read. Along with a more coherent look, websites for modern Internet users are also more simple to use and some even offer an AI feature that can answer questions that may not be stated on the website. 




## Assignment Rationale 
Websites today all seem to have the same or a similar look and feel. As website visitors, we tend to expect certain layouts: menus on the left or along the top of the screen (or both), clear text, high contrast between text and background, and so forth. However, web pages have not always shared these standards. As you will see as you explore older sites, web pages used to be organized much differently. 

This assignment asks you to explore websites that don't follow contemporary standards in order to think critically about what standards you as a visitor have come to expect and to contemplate why these designs have become so standard across so many different types of sites.

## Assignment Rationale 
Changes in technology can cause disruptive changes across many industries! On the job in the computer industry, it is likely that you will be asked to complete quick-start guides, tutorials, instructional videos, and manuals in a very short amount of time. Other careers may also require these skills, and given how many of us rely on computers in our daily lives, the updates that are constantly being pushed out, unfortunately, sometimes seem to take the approach of "update now, explain the update to users later" (anybody remember Windows 8 Links to an external site.?).

You need to be able to quickly figure out a platform on your own, and then clearly explain how to use it in writing, image, or video (or a combination of these).

# Reflective Blog 3
## Directions:
Prompt F: Reflect on one of your completed Deliverables for this course. What was easy for you? What was more difficult? Why? What did completing this assignment teach you about yourself and technical communication? What would you do differently based on the instructor's feedback? Note: this one is vintage only, but you can use AI tools for editing.

## Assignment Response:
I will be reflecting on my "Quick Start Guide".
- This Deliverable had different aspects that made it come together. One of the easier parts to creating the Quick Start Guide was structuring the steps in a logical sequence. Since I was already familiar with the process I was explaining, it was easiser to break it down into smaller actions for the audience to follow with.   
- Some of the difficulties was balancing the text and visuals. At times I relied too much on images without fully writing out the necessary steps, which made some instructions vague in some points. Additionally, ensuring that each image had an appropriate caption and proper citiation was something I overlooked. Sometimes when you are so used to using an application it makes you forget about the smaller steps or over explain a process. It is important to find the balance between, which was a bit challenging at times. 
- This assignment reinforced the importance of clarity and structure in technical writing. I realized that while I tend to focus on making documents visually appealing, I need to ensure that the text itself is clear as well. Unlike everyday writing, technical writing helps make the text as conceise and clear as possible while including visuals to support your points. It helped me practice how to incorporate both to make the information both insightful and easy to read.  
- After reading the instructor's feedback I will keep the following in mind:
   * Improving the clarity on image captions
   * Delete any defintions and stick to key points
   * Focus should remain on actionable steps
   


*No AI was used

# Reflective Blog 4
## Directions: 
Prompt E: Analyze a chatbot (e.g., customer service, virtual assistant). Spend at least 5 minutes interacting with it & exploring its functionality. Then, reflect on the bot's: purpose (What is the chatbot designed to do?, functionality (how well does it perform its tasks?), user experience (was it easy to use? What were the strengths and weaknesses?), and context (how does it benefit users and the organization?)

## Assignment Response:

ChatBox Analysis:

Purpose:

The chatbot I interacted with was a virtual assistant bot designed to assist users with answering FAQs, troubleshooting technical issues, processing orders. Its primary goal is to provide quick and automated support, reducing wait times for users and minimizing the need for human intervention.

Functionality:

The chatbot performed well in completing its tasks. It could accurately provide answers, handle multiple queries, and offer links to resources, but it struggled with complex requests, understanding context, handing off to human agents. The bot had predefined options vs. natural language understanding, making it efficient but limited in flexibility.

User Experience:

Strengths:
* Ease of use: The chatbot had a simple and an intuitive interface, with buttons and quick replies that made navigation smooth.
* Speed: Responses were fast and provided instant feedback which enhanced efficiency.
* Helpful features: It offered order tracking, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides, making it useful for specific user needs.

Weaknesses:
* Limited understanding of nuanced questions: When asked complex/multi-part queries, the bot gave generic responses or misunderstood intent.
* No human escalation: There was no clear way to connect with a live agent, which could frustrate users with urgent/unresolved issues.
* Repetitive responses: The chatbot sometimes looped back to the same answer or failed to remember context from previous interactions.

Context & Benefits:

For users, the chatbot provides quick, accessible support without needing to call or email customer service. It is particularly useful for frequent questions, 24/7 availability, or simple tasks like resetting passwords, and tracking orders. For the organization, the chatbot reduces customer support workload, lowers operational costs, and ensures consistent responses. It also collects user data, identifies common issues, and improves future service based on interactions.

# Reflective Blog 5
## Directions:
Prompt A: Reflect on your assigned reading this week in a detailed manner that demonstrates you read and understood the assigned reading. What can you 'take away' from this reading? What insightful concepts did you read about that can inform your own technical communication activities?

## Assignment Response:
This weeks reading is **"Chapter 9: Including Useful Headings"** and **"Interlude 3: The New Life of Press Releases"** coming from the textbook: **Letting Go of the Words by Ginny Redish.**

---
Chapter 9 emphasizes the importance of well-structured headings in web content. Headings serve as navigation aids, improve readability, and help users quickly find the information they need. They also enhance SEO and accessibility when properly tagged.

-Headings are essential for making web content easy to scan, navigate, and understand. Readers often skim pages rather than reading everything, so clear headings help them find relevant information quickly. Well-planned headings also assist writers by organizing content logically and improving readability.

-Effective headings come in three main styles: questions, statements, and verb phrases. Questions engage readers by mimicking real inquiries, statements summarize key topics, and verb phrases encourage action. Maintaining parallel structure across headings enhances clarity, making scanning easier.

-Writers should avoid relying too much on nouns as headings since they often lack clarity. Instead of "Payment Options," a heading like "How to Choose the Best Payment Method" provides more useful context. Proper HTML tagging is crucial for both SEO and accessibility, ensuring that search engines and assistive technologies can interpret the structure correctly.

-Logical hierarchy, same-page links for long content, and evaluating headings in isolation all improve usability. Strong headings act as signposts, guiding readers while improving engagement. By following these best practices, writers can create clear, scannable, and user-friendly content that enhances the web experience.

Interlude 3 dicsuses how the internet transformed press releases from short-lived documents for journalists into permanent web content accessible to everyone. They now serve as summaries, fact sheets, or general information, often appearing in search results and on social media. However, many press releases still follow outdated formats with dense text, no headings, and no links.

-To be effective online, press releases should have clear headings, short paragraphs, and links to reports or related content. Visual elements like images and videos improve engagement, and content should be optimized for mobile and social media with concise headlines and key messages upfront.

-Usability testing shows that well-structured, web-friendly press releases are easier to read and more engaging. By adapting press releases for the digital world, organizations can better inform and connect with their audiences.

---
**Key Takeaways:**
Headings Benefit Readers:
* Help users scan content quickly.
* Allow them to find specific sections easily.
* Provide a clear structure to follow.

**Headings Benefit Writers:**
* Aid in organizing content before writing.
* Act as an outline, ensuring logical flow.

**Guidelines for Writing Effective Headings:**
* Don't just insert headings into old content—ensure they are meaningful.
* Start with an outline to maintain clarity and logical order.
* Choose the right heading style—questions, statements, or verb phrases (calls to action).
* Use questions when engaging users in a conversational way.
* Prefer action-oriented verb phrases over How do I questions.

**Insights for Technical Communication:**
* Headings as a Communication Tool: They should act as clear signposts, guiding the reader through the content.
* User-Centered Approach: Writing should prioritize what the audience wants to know rather than internal organizational language.
* Clarity & Readability: Simplicity in headings enhances understanding, especially for web readers who scan rather than read every word.
* Accessibility & SEO Considerations: Proper HTML tagging helps both search engines and assistive technologies interpret the page correctly.

# Reflective Blog 6

## Directions
Prompt R: After you have completed the Chatbot assignment or any assignment using AI for most of the work, reflect on your interaction with this emerging technology: What does AI do well? What does it not do well? What did you have to correct or re-prompt it to modify? What can you know about its training data? What kinds of data was included? What kinds of data was excluded? What do you think the future holds as this technology is used and further advanced?

## Assignment Response 
After completing the Chatbot assignment I witnessed first hand how helpful AI is when it comes to answering questions. I used BoodleBot to generate my chatbot and all I had to do was upload "knowledge" that the chatbot will reference back to and it took care of the rest. I noticed how it was able to take large and long pieces of text and strcuture them in an easy to use way for the user. The following further explains my interaction with AI and how it is shaping the future. 

**AI excels at:**
* Generating text and content quickly and efficiently based on patterns in data.
* Summarizing information, making it easier to digest complex topics.
* Answering technical questions by providing explanations and examples.
* Automating repetitive tasks, such as data entry, formatting, or document generation.
* Providing creative inspiration, such as brainstorming ideas for writing, design, or problem-solving.


**AI struggles with:**
* Understanding context perfectly, especially in nuanced or ambiguous situations.
* Providing original thought or critical reasoning, as it relies on patterns in existing data.
* Handling highly subjective or emotional content, like complex ethical decisions.
* Ensuring factual accuracy in real-time since it may generate outdated or incorrect information.
* Interpreting sarcasm, humor, or cultural references as humans do.


**What did I had to correct or re-prompt it to modify?**

In my case, I had to guide the AI by providing certain characteristics and specifying the level of detail needed to tailor the responses specifically for writing. This meant directing it toward technical writing principles, adjusting tone and style, and ensuring the output was relevant to structured, professional communication. Additionally, I had to give the bot specific characteristics that matched the personality I gave the chatbot such as his name, gender, and purpose for the class. 


**What can you know about its training data?**
* Large amounts of publicly available text, including books, articles, and websites.
* Technical documentation and programming-related content.
* Academic papers and research materials, although not in real-time.

**What kinds of data were included?**
* General knowledge from textbooks chapters from Letting Go of The Words
* Programming and technical documentation 
* A creative bio of who the chatbot is and what its purpose is giving it a friendly tone

**What kinds of data were excluded?**
* Live, real-time data, meaning AI doesn’t have up-to-the-minute knowledge.
* Highly specialized or obscure knowledge, unless it’s widely documented.
* Sensitive personal data, due to privacy concerns.

**What does the future hold as this technology advances?**

As AI advances, it will achieve better contextual understanding, making responses more precise and relevant. Real-time learning capabilities will help it stay up to date, while stronger ethical safeguards will reduce bias and misinformation. Enhanced collaboration between humans and AI will improve creativity, decision-making, and automation. AI is already transforming how people interact with information, and as it continues to evolve, it will become an even more powerful assistant across various industries.

# Reflective Blog 7

## Directions: 
Prompt G: Analyze an assignment explanation page from this course (including video overview, if there is one) as though it is a mini-tutorial or how-to. Obviously, the audience and genre of writing are different than a typical how-to, but what elements are the same/similar? What are different? What could be more clear, regardless of the genre or intended audience? (I might incorporate your suggestions in future courses!) 

## Assignment Response:
I will be analyzing the Procedure Video assignment page from this course. 

The assignment pages in this course are very detailed-oriented and descriptive for what is expected from the students. The specific page I am reviewing includes an embedded video explaining the text on the page in more detail in an easy to follow manner and may answer any questions that could arise. Similar to a how-to tutorial it includes:
* Clear Purpose: Both aim to teach a specific task — how to create a procedure video in this case.
* Step-by-Step Approach: Like a traditional tutorial, the explanation page breaks down the process into manageable steps to follow along with.
* Multimedia Support: The embedded video adds a visual and auditory dimension which is useful to first timers doing this
* Tool Recommendations: Suggests using specific tools (like YouTube, Zoom, and PowerPoint) to accomplish the task.

Although the assignment page and the how-to tutorial share many similarities some differences I noticed between the two are:
* Formatting Style: The explanation page is more narrative and less structured than typical how-tos, which often use numbered steps and shorter explanations aiming to use as little words as possible
* Assumed Knowledge: The explanation assumes familiarity with certain tools (like YouTube captions) without step-by-step guidance, whereas tutorials often cater to beginners.
* More use of visuals: There are more detailed diagrams or pictures that reference a certain step or steps in a how-to that lead little to no interpretation of the user. 

To make the explanation page clearer and more effective, it would be helpful to include a sample procedure video instead of just explaining the process. This sample could serve as a concrete example, demonstrating what a well-crafted procedure video looks like — from planning and scripting to recording and editing. For visual learners, like myself, I think it would help bring all the information together in a video that shows what each point of the rubric looks like. But other than that I appreciate the page and how it uses headings, bullet points, and a resource page to further help do the the assignment.

# Self Evaluation 


## Assignment Description:
Reflect on the semester. What have you learned? How have you grown? Are you closer to your career goals than when you started? What are you proud of, and what will you work to avoid in the future? 


## Option B:
Rather than a traditional essay format, frame this as an "about me" or "self-evaluation" page on your digital portfolio website, focusing, of course, on your most recent course and what you learned in it. Be sure to thoroughly and honestly address the three bulleted questions above.

## Response:
This semester, I learned a lot about technical writing and the importance of communicating clearly and effectively in a professional setting. The course helped me understand how to structure information, write with purpose, and adapt my communication style depending on the audience. These are skills I know will be valuable no matter what career path I take. Through the textbook, Letting Go of the Words by Janice Redish it helped further clarify these topics. The weekly assignments, reflective blogs, and project deliverables helped me strengthen my response skills and taught me how to communicate information in a clear and concise way. Moving forward, I’ve learned to avoid being overly wordy or including unnecessary details that might distract from the main message.

The overall class experience was really positive. I was introduced to several new tools and platforms that I had not worked with before, such as GitHub and Markdown. Learning how to use these tools not only helped me complete assignments, but also gave me practical, hands-on experience that I can take into the workplace. I appreciated how the course balanced both the technical side of writing and the tools that support it.

The work I completed throughout the course definitely helped me get closer to my goals. One of my main objectives is to become a more confident communicator, especially when it comes to technical subjects or collaborative projects. This course gave me the opportunity to build that confidence through real-world-style writing tasks and peer feedback.

My experience with AI in the course, especially using BoodleBox, was also really eye-opening. Exploring how AI can assist with writing, idea generation, and editing gave me a new perspective on the tools available to us. I found BoodleBox and its features useful for brainstorming and drafting, and it made me more curious about how AI can support work processes in a professional environment. I now feel more prepared to use AI tools responsibly and thoughtfully in my future career, understanding both their benefits and their limitations.

Looking to the future, I want to apply these skills I have learned and transition them into a role like UX/UI design or web development to help create user-friendly and visually appealing digital products by focusing on both the overall user experience and the user interface. Eventually, getting a project manager position where I can really hone in on communicating to a team and leading them towards finishing a project.
