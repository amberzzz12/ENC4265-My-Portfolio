# Wayback Analysis

In this analysis I used the Wayback Machine to see how websites were formatted back in the day. After examining the Food Network, Yahoo!, and Stack Overflow, I was surprised to notice how the fonts, colors, and overall display of the page is so different today. The overall design and flow of the websites makes it hard for users to search or even browse around. I also noticed how there is too much information on one page and how the fonts/background colors of the page affect the aesthetic of the page. I noticed how these sites also did not have proper formatting when it comes to the display and look of the websites. Nowadays the norms of websites incorporate better designs with an easy to use format and pictures that help add purpose to the website. Today, websites also adapt to different screen sizes so it remains easy to read. Along with a more coherent look, websites for modern Internet users are also more simple to use and some even offer an AI feature that can answer questions that may not be stated on the website. 




## Assignment Rationale 
Websites today all seem to have the same or a similar look and feel. As website visitors, we tend to expect certain layouts: menus on the left or along the top of the screen (or both), clear text, high contrast between text and background, and so forth. However, web pages have not always shared these standards. As you will see as you explore older sites, web pages used to be organized much differently. 

This assignment asks you to explore websites that don't follow contemporary standards in order to think critically about what standards you as a visitor have come to expect and to contemplate why these designs have become so standard across so many different types of sites.

## Assignment Rationale 
Changes in technology can cause disruptive changes across many industries! On the job in the computer industry, it is likely that you will be asked to complete quick-start guides, tutorials, instructional videos, and manuals in a very short amount of time. Other careers may also require these skills, and given how many of us rely on computers in our daily lives, the updates that are constantly being pushed out, unfortunately, sometimes seem to take the approach of "update now, explain the update to users later" (anybody remember Windows 8 Links to an external site.?).

You need to be able to quickly figure out a platform on your own, and then clearly explain how to use it in writing, image, or video (or a combination of these).

# Reflective Blog 3
## Directions:
Prompt F: Reflect on one of your completed Deliverables for this course. What was easy for you? What was more difficult? Why? What did completing this assignment teach you about yourself and technical communication? What would you do differently based on the instructor's feedback? Note: this one is vintage only, but you can use AI tools for editing.

## Assignment Response:
I will be reflecting on my "Quick Start Guide".
- This Deliverable had different aspects that made it come together. One of the easier parts to creating the Quick Start Guide was structuring the steps in a logical sequence. Since I was already familiar with the process I was explaining, it was easiser to break it down into smaller actions for the audience to follow with.   
- Some of the difficulties was balancing the text and visuals. At times I relied too much on images without fully writing out the necessary steps, which made some instructions vague in some points. Additionally, ensuring that each image had an appropriate caption and proper citiation was something I overlooked. Sometimes when you are so used to using an application it makes you forget about the smaller steps or over explain a process. It is important to find the balance between, which was a bit challenging at times. 
- This assignment reinforced the importance of clarity and structure in technical writing. I realized that while I tend to focus on making documents visually appealing, I need to ensure that the text itself is clear as well. Unlike everyday writing, technical writing helps make the text as conceise and clear as possible while including visuals to support your points. It helped me practice how to incorporate both to make the information both insightful and easy to read.  
- After reading the instructor's feedback I will keep the following in mind:
   * Improving the clarity on image captions
   * Delete any defintions and stick to key points
   * Focus should remain on actionable steps
   


*No AI was used

# Reflective Blog 4
## Directions: 
Prompt E: Analyze a chatbot (e.g., customer service, virtual assistant). Spend at least 5 minutes interacting with it & exploring its functionality. Then, reflect on the bot's: purpose (What is the chatbot designed to do?, functionality (how well does it perform its tasks?), user experience (was it easy to use? What were the strengths and weaknesses?), and context (how does it benefit users and the organization?)

## Assignment Response:

ChatBox Analysis:

Purpose:

The chatbot I interacted with was a virtual assistant bot designed to assist users with answering FAQs, troubleshooting technical issues, processing orders. Its primary goal is to provide quick and automated support, reducing wait times for users and minimizing the need for human intervention.

Functionality:

The chatbot performed well in completing its tasks. It could accurately provide answers, handle multiple queries, and offer links to resources, but it struggled with complex requests, understanding context, handing off to human agents. The bot had predefined options vs. natural language understanding, making it efficient but limited in flexibility.

User Experience:

Strengths:
* Ease of use: The chatbot had a simple and an intuitive interface, with buttons and quick replies that made navigation smooth.
* Speed: Responses were fast and provided instant feedback which enhanced efficiency.
* Helpful features: It offered order tracking, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides, making it useful for specific user needs.

Weaknesses:
* Limited understanding of nuanced questions: When asked complex/multi-part queries, the bot gave generic responses or misunderstood intent.
* No human escalation: There was no clear way to connect with a live agent, which could frustrate users with urgent/unresolved issues.
* Repetitive responses: The chatbot sometimes looped back to the same answer or failed to remember context from previous interactions.

Context & Benefits:

For users, the chatbot provides quick, accessible support without needing to call or email customer service. It is particularly useful for frequent questions, 24/7 availability, or simple tasks like resetting passwords, and tracking orders. For the organization, the chatbot reduces customer support workload, lowers operational costs, and ensures consistent responses. It also collects user data, identifies common issues, and improves future service based on interactions.
