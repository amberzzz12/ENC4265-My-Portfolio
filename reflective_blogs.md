In this analysis I used the Wayback Machine to see how websites were formatted back in the day. After examining the Food Network, Yahoo!, and Stack Overflow, I was surprised to notice how the fonts, colors, and overall display of the page is so different today. The overall design and flow of the websites makes it hard for users to search or even browse around. I also noticed how there is too much information on one page and how the fonts/background colors of the page affect the aesthetic of the page. I noticed how these sites also did not have proper formatting when it comes to the display and look of the websites. Nowadays the norms of websites incorporate better designs with an easy to use format and pictures that help add purpose to the website. Today, websites also adapt to different screen sizes so it remains easy to read. Along with a more coherent look, websites for modern Internet users are also more simple to use and some even offer an AI feature that can answer questions that may not be stated on the website. 




## Assignment Rationale 
Websites today all seem to have the same or a similar look and feel. As website visitors, we tend to expect certain layouts: menus on the left or along the top of the screen (or both), clear text, high contrast between text and background, and so forth. However, web pages have not always shared these standards. As you will see as you explore older sites, web pages used to be organized much differently. 

This assignment asks you to explore websites that don't follow contemporary standards in order to think critically about what standards you as a visitor have come to expect and to contemplate why these designs have become so standard across so many different types of sites.

## Assignment Rationale 
Changes in technology can cause disruptive changes across many industries! On the job in the computer industry, it is likely that you will be asked to complete quick-start guides, tutorials, instructional videos, and manuals in a very short amount of time. Other careers may also require these skills, and given how many of us rely on computers in our daily lives, the updates that are constantly being pushed out, unfortunately, sometimes seem to take the approach of "update now, explain the update to users later" (anybody remember Windows 8 Links to an external site.?).

You need to be able to quickly figure out a platform on your own, and then clearly explain how to use it in writing, image, or video (or a combination of these).

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection
