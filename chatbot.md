# Chatbot
# Reason for assignment 
With the explosion of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools, chatbots are suddenly everywhere. They are quick to create and can provide a custom experience for your website visitor. Exploring the way that chatbots are created can help you better understand the strengths and limitations of this technology.
# Description
Welcome to this interactive chatbot! His name is Trevor and can answer any questions related to how to successfully write for the computer industry. Whether it is how to make your writing more effective or where to start when writing. It can help with following minimalist writing principles: knowing the audience, removing nonessential content, and focusing on user goals instead of product functions. Through BoodleBox, I created this bot to make researching and writing a bit easier. Some questions you could ask include: 

* How formal or informal should my writing be?
* What are the best practices for writing clear and concise technical content?
* How do I structure technical documentation or guides effectively?
* What common mistakes should I avoid when writing for a technical audience?
* How do I optimize content for search engines in the tech industry?
* How can I make complex topics accessible to different audiences?
* What are the common pain points or challenges my audience faces?

Enjoy!
